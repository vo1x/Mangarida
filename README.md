# Mangarida

A simple manga reader that scrapes [mangafire.to](https://mangafire.to).
The backend for this is written in Flask as of now. I plan to rewrite it using JavaScript and will put that up as well once done. 

You can find the source code for the scraper at https://github.com/vo1x/mangafire-scraper

## To-do
- [ ] Rewrite the backend api in Javascript
- [ ] Implement a bookmark system
- [ ] Rewrite the Authflow backend (login/logout system) with proper authetication measures

### Also, this project is a hobby project and is for educational purposes only.
